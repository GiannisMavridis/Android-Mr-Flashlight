Turn your Android device into a flashlight using your 
camera's LED.
The link from which you can dowload the app is the following:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=giannhs.mavridis.mrflashlight

The basic code snippet we use in order to turn on/off the camera's LED can be 
found here:

Also, make sure that you put the camera.release(); statement inside the activity 's
onDestroy function to ensure that the flashlight will turn off only when you want to 
terminate the app by hitting the back button.

The images we used can be found easily from the google images.Just "google" the phrase 
"cartoon caveman".We used the paint program to process a little bit these images.

Feel free to rate /comment as you wish!!!
ENJOY :)
